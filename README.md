# Jacob's Text Magic
A simple assembly language. I built this for ECE3242 (Computer Architecture) where we often have to write and insert binary into memory manually.

## Usage
Visit the [website](https://jacobsmith.me/converter) and start typing. Use Ctrl+S to convert from assembly -> binary.

## Project setup
```
# install the deps
npm i

# run the dev server
npm run serve

# build the project -> docs/
npm run build

# run the tests
npm run test:unit
```
